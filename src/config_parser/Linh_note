The server block with the listen directive including the default_server parameter has priority over a server block without a server_name.

Here's the priority order:

- server block with a server_name that matches the Host header of the request.
- server block with a listen directive including the default_server parameter.
- server block without a server_name.

So, if a server block is specified with listen 80 default_server;, it will be the default server for requests that do not match any server_name, even if there are other server blocks without a server_name.

In other words, listen 80 default_server; is a more explicit way to set a server block as the default, and it will take precedence over a server block without a server_name.

Command to check your default error page with curl:
curl -k -I https://your-nginx-server/nonexistent-page

CgiHandler:
if request requires CGI handling:
    parse the request
    set up the CGI environment
    execute the CGI script
    if request method is POST:
        send the request body to the script's stdin
    read the script's stdout
    create an HTTP response with the script's output
    send the response to the client


The `PATH_INFO` environment variable is used in the context of CGI scripts to provide extra path information after the script name in the URL. This can be useful for scripts that can handle different resources based on this path information.

However, in your case, the requirement states "Because you wonâ€™t call the CGI directly, use the full path as PATH_INFO". This means that instead of using `PATH_INFO` to store extra path information after the script name, you should use it to store the full path of the CGI script itself.

This is likely because your server is set up to handle requests for certain paths (like `/test/cgi-bin`) by executing a corresponding CGI script, rather than directly calling a specific script. The server needs to know the full path of the script to execute it, and storing this path in `PATH_INFO` is a convenient way to pass this information to the part of the server code that handles executing the script.

So, if a request comes in for the URL `/test/cgi-bin/upload.php`, the server would set `PATH_INFO` to the full path of the `upload.php` script, something like `/data/www/test/cgi-bin/upload.php`, before executing the script.
