The server block with the listen directive including the default_server parameter has priority over a server block without a server_name.

Here's the priority order:

- server block with a server_name that matches the Host header of the request.
- server block with a listen directive including the default_server parameter.
- server block without a server_name.

So, if a server block is specified with listen 80 default_server;, it will be the default server for requests that do not match any server_name, even if there are other server blocks without a server_name.

In other words, listen 80 default_server; is a more explicit way to set a server block as the default, and it will take precedence over a server block without a server_name.
